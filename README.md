# Overview
We have created a Harry Potter-themed stick hero game and added similar and existing features to the stick hero game. Coming to the creativity part, we have added music to the game. 
As per the programming practices, we have added 3 design patterns and 1 JUnit tests in the following classes:-

1. Design Pattern
   -> `PillarFactory.java`: Factory & Flyweight
   -> `Character.java`: Singleton

2. JUnit Tests
   -> `testScore.java` - Here, we are checking whether the score starts from zero or not.
